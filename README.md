Files for the snf_project
==================================================

This is a small project to see where the Swiss post-docs are located when funded by the SNF.

# Workflow

1. First of all, run the *DataProcessing* file in order to clean the data set provided by the snf.
2. Run the *EDA.Rmd* file to have a first exploratory data analysis. 
3. If you want to have an interactive version of the plots, you can run the R *shiny* app in the **snf_apps** folder.

# Results

The two *Rmd* files are published at the following link on Rpubs:

[Data Processing](http://rpubs.com/davidpham87/19545)

[EDA](http://rpubs.com/davidpham87/19544)

The shiny apps can be run here:
